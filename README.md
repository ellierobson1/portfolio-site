# Ellie Robson – Portfolio Website

## Project Overview
This project is a personal portfolio website created as part of a first year university assessment. The purpose of the website is to demonstrate foundational front-end development skills, including the use of semantic HTML, CSS, and the Bootstrap framework.

The site presents information about my background, skills, and academic projects in a clear and accessible format.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5 (semantic structure)
- CSS3 (custom styling)
- Bootstrap 5 (responsive layout and components)
- GitHub Pages (deployment)

## Pages Included
- **Home** – Introduction and overview of the portfolio
- **About** – Background, skills, and education
- **Portfolio** – List of academic and practice projects
- **Project** – Detailed view of an individual project

## Accessibility and Standards
The website follows accessibility and web standards best practices. This includes:
- Logical heading hierarchy
- Semantic HTML elements such as `header`, `nav`, `main`, `section`, `article`, and `footer`
- Alternative text for images
- Clear navigation and readable text contrast

The site was checked using the W3C HTML Validator and accessibility warnings were addressed.

## Responsiveness
The website is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes using Bootstrap’s grid system. Layouts adjust for mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

## Deployment
The website is hosted using GitHub Pages.
